## Features

- **Clean Code Architecture:** Ensures separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable.
- **Kotlin:** Leverages the modern language features to write concise and expressive code.
- **Jetpack Components:** Uses components like LiveData, ViewModel, and Paging.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilizes Dagger Hilt to manage dependencies.
- **Paging Library:** Efficiently loads large data sets by paging the data.
- **Retrofit:** Simplifies HTTP requests to the News API.

## Architecture

The app is built using the Clean Code architecture, which divides the code into three main layers:

1. **Presentation Layer:** Contains UI-related components such as Activities, Fragments, and ViewModels.
2. **Domain Layer:** Contains business logic and use cases.
3. **Data Layer:** Manages data sources such as APIs and databases.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Architecture:** Clean Code Architecture(MVVM)
- **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt
- **Networking:** Retrofit
- **Paging:** Paging Library
- **Room Database:** Room Database Library
- **LiveData & ViewModel:** Jetpack Components
